## Why GO ?
### Why Google build Golang ?
#### Pain Points 
- slow builds
- uncontrolled dependencies
- each programmer using a different subset of the language
- poor program understanding (code hard to read, poorly documented, and so on)
- and many more..

#### Goals 
The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google, and thereby to make the process more productive and scalable. The language was designed by and for people who write—and read and debug and maintain—large software systems.

### Fun Fact :
``` 
Ryan Dhal - The Creator of Node JS said :

"I think Node is not the best system to build a massive server web. I would use Go for that. And honestly, that’s the reason why I left Node. "
